This project is a demo for a company. 
The task is to do a web solution where a user can search a webpage after one or more words.
This appliaction counts how many of each word exist on the webpage. 
Saves the information in a database.
A user can then list the results in the database.

I use the Html Agility pack, https://html-agility-pack.net/ ,  for parsing of the webpage.
